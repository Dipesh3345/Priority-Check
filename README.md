A script written in Python to check number of students in a priority number and their all prefernce of that priority number

## Why ?
    So this tool will help you to know how many aspirants has applied to the branch you selected in the respective colleges.

Select College based on number
1. For Pulchowk
2. For Erc Dharan

from above input 

```
#### 
    The output will give you all the list of students with serial number and their all prefernces
